Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

To run velocyto you will need python >=3.6.0 (we have no plans to support python<=3.5).
We recommend to use `anaconda <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`_ and the ``conda`` command to install dependencies limiting the use of ``pip`` to libraries not available on conda's main channel. (``pip`` can be used too but its dependency-managing might be less robust). 

If you're installing from a bare machine (e.g. a fresh Ubuntu Linux image), you'll need to install `libgl` and `gcc`:

::

    sudo apt-get install gcc libgl-dev

To make sure you have all the Python dependencies first do:

::

    conda install numpy scipy cython scikit-learn h5py click
    pip install pysam loompy

Install command
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After all the requirements are satisfied. You can just run:

::

    git clone https://github.com/velocyto-team/velocyto.py.git
    cd velocyto.py
    pip install .


This command will install the python library ``velocyto`` and the homonymous command line tool.
Adding the ``-e`` flags installs the software in `development` mode, so to update you can simple do ``git pull``.

At this point you can test the installation was successful by running ``velocyto --help``.

To get started with ``velocyto`` you can follow :ref:`our guide <tutorial>`.
